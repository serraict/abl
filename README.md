This is a set of R scripts for analyzing statistical data form the [Austrian Basketball Bundesliga][abl].

The scripts originated from the box score analysis done for my blog ["DBL by the numbers"][dblbythenumbers] on the Dutch Basketball League. However, since more data is available than boxscores alone, goal is to extend this analysis with shooting analysis, lineup analysis and more.
